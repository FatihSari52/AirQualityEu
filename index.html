    <h1>The Air Quality in Valleys</h1>
    <p> The air quality in valleys can often be poor due to several factors:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Limited Air Circulation: Valleys are typically surrounded by mountains, which restricts air circulation. This can trap pollutants within the valley, as winds are less effective at dispersing them.</li>
        <li>Thermal Inversion: Valleys frequently experience thermal inversion, where a layer of cold air is trapped beneath a layer of warm air. This prevents pollutants from rising and dispersing, causing them to accumulate near the ground.</li>
        <li>High Population Density and Industrial Activities: Many valleys contain densely populated areas or industrial facilities. Sources of pollution such as vehicle exhaust, industrial emissions, and heating systems contribute significantly to poor air quality.</li>
        <li>Geographical Barriers: The mountains or hills surrounding a valley act as barriers, making it difficult for polluted air to escape. These geographical features can lead to the accumulation of pollutants within the valley.</li>
        <li>Natural Sources: Natural sources such as dust and particulates can also affect air quality in valleys. For instance, during dry periods, dust storms can increase the level of pollutants in the air.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These factors combine to degrade air quality in valleys, posing health risks to residents and impacting the environment negatively.</p>
